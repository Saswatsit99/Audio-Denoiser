# Audio-Denoiser
This project is an embedded audio processing system where an audio file is transmitted from a PC to an ESP32 development board over Bluetooth, processed in real-time to remove noise, and optionally sent back to the PC or stored. The goal is to implement a low-latency audio denoising pipeline on a microcontroller(ESP32) with constrained resources.
